            "description": "Stops a connection monitoring service. The service listens to events sent by the operating system about the connected hardware. If the service notices that a previously connected device suddenly disconnects on the hardware layer it attempts to reconnect to that particular device. Since this is a service it is necessary that the service is turned off before the application ends its life-time. This means that, if the service was running, stopMonitoringConnections() has to be called before the application is exited completely. Note that the service currently only works with <code>USB</code>. In the case of <code>USB</code> the service will only disconnect from the device and when it notices that it has been plugged in again it will connect to it.",
