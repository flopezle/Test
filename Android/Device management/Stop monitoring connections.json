            "description": "Stops a connection monitoring service. The service listens to events sent by the operating system about the connected hardware. If the service notices that a previously connected device suddenly disconnects on the hardware layer it attempts to reconnect to that particular device. Since this is a service it is necessary that the service is turned off before the application ends its life-time. This means that, if the service was running, stopMonitoringConnections() has to be called before the application is exited completely. Note that the service currently only works with <code>BLUETOOTH</code>. In the case of <code>BLUETOOTH</code> the service will attempt to reconnect to the device three times, if unsuccessful the connection is considered <code>Disconnected</code>.",
