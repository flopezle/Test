        <p>The Handpoint iOS SDK comes with an additional library which is configured to run in simulation mode,
            reducing the need for a card reader when developing the UI. The simulator has a limited functionality and
            should only be relied upon when prototyping the user interface.</p>

        <p>The simulator library is located in the HeftSimulator folder. To use the simulator library just link it as
            you would do with a normal library and make sure there are no references to the Heft Library.</p>

        <p>To switch from the simulator to the regular heft library just remove the references to the simulator library
            and link the Heft Library instead to your project</p>

        <p>The behavior of the simulator is controlled by the passed amount of the simulated transaction operation.
            There are four different behaviors simulated: <strong>Declined transaction</strong>, <strong>Cancelled
                transaction</strong>, <strong>Signature Request</strong> and <strong>Approved transaction</strong>.</p>
        <br>
        <h4>Usage</h4>

        <p>The following code would simulate a declined transaction as the amount is 1000.</p>
        <pre><code class="objectivec">[heftClient saleWithAmount:[1000] currency:@"GBP" cardholder:YES];</code></pre>
        <p>The table below shows the different options.</p>
